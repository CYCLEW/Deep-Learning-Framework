# 🤖 Deep-Learning-Framework

This is a project dedicated to reproducing or simplifying the code of classic papers in the field of deep learning. 
The project encompasses various network implementations for learning purposes. The project relies on Python 3.9+ and PyTorch.
Through this endeavor, novice researchers can gain a more profound comprehension of the fundamental code structure underlying deep learning models. Furthermore, they can utilize this code to facilitate their own model construction tasks.

## 📚 项目介绍

The primary objective of this project is to provide a platform for deep learning enthusiasts to learn and engage in discussions. By reproducing the code of classical papers in the field of deep learning, we aim to deepen the understanding and mastery of deep learning models. Our project mainly comprises the following components:

- Reproduction of code from deep learning model papers
- Reproduction of code from deep learning model papers
- Relevant datasets and pre-trained models
- Relevant datasets and pre-trained models

We shall continuously update this project in accordance with the latest research papers and trending models in the field of deep learning, thereby providing valuable code and learning resources to all.

## 🚀 如何使用

Our code repository supports direct downloading and usage, but we recommend using the `git clone` command to clone the entire code repository to your local machine for better code management and updates. Here are the specific instructions:

1.Open your terminal or command prompt.

2.Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the code repository.

3.Run the following command:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:Karenina-na/Deep-Learning-Framework.git
```

4.Wait for the cloning process to complete. Once finished, you will have a local copy of the code repository on your machine.

5.After cloning the code repository, you can use the `cd` command to navigate to the specific folder of the model and then execute the corresponding training or testing script. We provide accompanying documentation in each model folder to assist you in utilizing the model effectively.
